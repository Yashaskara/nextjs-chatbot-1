# Introduction

Welcome to the Netcore Unbxd React SDK! Whether you're building a client-side rendered (CSR) application, a server-side rendered (SSR) application using Next.js, or prefer a headless approach using only hooks, our SDK provides the tools you need to create a seamless and efficient shopping experience. Designed with flexibility and scalability in mind, the Unbxd React SDK empowers developers to create dynamic, high-performing e-commerce experiences tailored to their specific needs.

## Overview

The Unbxd React SDK is a comprehensive suite of React components, hooks, and utilities designed to integrate Unbxd's search, navigation, and merchandising capabilities into your e-commerce website. It offers three flexible packages to suit various development needs:

- **`CSR` (Client-Side Rendering)**: Ideal for SPAs where rendering happens in the browser.
- **`SSR` (Server-Side Rendering)**: Perfect for Next.js applications, offering better SEO and performance.
- **`Hooks`**: A headless option providing maximum flexibility for UI and state management.

## CSR vs SSR

| **Feature**            | **Client-Side Rendering (CSR)**                                     | **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**                               |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Rendering Location** | Browser (Client)                                                    | Server                                                        |
| **Initial Load Time**  | Slower (JS must load before content displays)                       | Faster (HTML fully rendered on server)                        |
| **SEO**                | Less optimal (content may not be immediately available to crawlers) | Better (content is pre-rendered on server)                    |
| **Interactivity**      | Faster after initial load (SPA experience)                          | Slower for page transitions (hydration required)              |
| **Caching**            | More challenging to implement (cache only static assets)            | Easier with server caching (entire pages can be cached)       |
| **Use Cases**          | SPAs, high interactivity, real-time updates                         | SEO-focused sites, static pages, e-commerce with initial load |
