# Pagination

## Overview

In e-commerce, "pagination" refers to the process of dividing search results or product listings into multiple pages, which allows users to navigate through the pages of products. 
It is used to split large sets of products into smaller, more manageable chunks, which can improve the performance of the website and also user experience.

## Types of Pagination

### 1. Fixed Pagination 

This type of pagination is the most common and allows users to navigate through the pages of products by clicking on page numbers or by clicking on the next and previous buttons. 
The page numbers and buttons are usually displayed at the bottom of the search results or product listings.

- <div style={{ marginTop: "1.5rem", fontSize: "20px", fontWeight: "600" }}>Advantages:</div>
    1. Simple and easy to use.
    2. Allows users to easily navigate through the pages of products.
    3. Provides a clear indication of the current page and total number of pages.
    4. Allows users to go directly to a specific page.

- <div style={{ marginTop: "1.5rem", fontSize: "20px", fontWeight: "600" }}>Disadvantages:</div>
    1. Users have to manually click through the pages, which can be time-consuming for large product sets.
    2. May not be suitable for websites with a large number of products.
    3. Can cause a high bounce rate if users have to navigate too many pages to find what they're looking for.

- <div style={{ marginTop: "1.5rem", fontSize: "20px", fontWeight: "600" }}>Related Component:</div>

### 2. Infinite Scroll

This type of pagination loads the next set of products automatically as the user scrolls to the bottom of the page, eliminating the need for the user to click on next or page numbers. 
This type of pagination can be helpful for users that want to quickly browse through a large number of products without having to manually click through pages, but it could also lead to lower engagement and higher bounce rates if not implemented well.

- <div style={{ marginTop: "1.5rem", fontSize: "20px", fontWeight: "600" }}>Advantages:</div>
    1. Allows users to quickly browse through a large number of products without having to manually click through pages.
    2. Can improve the user experience by reducing the number of clicks needed to view all products.
    3. Can be useful for websites with a large number of products.

- <div style={{ marginTop: "1.5rem", fontSize: "20px", fontWeight: "600" }}>Disadvantages:</div>
    1. May not be suitable for users with slow internet connections.
    2. Some users may find it difficult to track their position within the product set, may lead to lower engagement and higher bounce rate if not implemented well.
    3. May be difficult for users to find a specific product.

- <div style={{ marginTop: "1.5rem", fontSize: "20px", fontWeight: "600" }}>Related Component:</div>

    </Cards>

### 3. Load More

This type is similar to the infinite scroll pagination, but it includes a “load more” button, so users can load the next set of products at their own discretion. 
This can be beneficial for users that may want to control the amount of information they see at once and also, it can be helpful for the website to limit the amount of data loaded at once to improve the performance.

- <div style={{ marginTop: "1.5rem", fontSize: "20px", fontWeight: "600" }}>Advantages:</div>
    1. Allows users to control the amount of information they see at once.
    2. Can be helpful for the website to limit the amount of data loaded at once to improve the performance.
    3. Can be useful for websites with a large number of products.

- <div style={{ marginTop: "1.5rem", fontSize: "20px", fontWeight: "600" }}>Disadvantages:</div>
    1. Users have to manually click through pages.
    2. May not be suitable for users with slow internet connections.
    3. May be difficult for users to find a specific product.

- <div style={{ marginTop: "1.5rem", fontSize: "20px", fontWeight: "600" }}>Related Component:</div>
    <Cards>
        <Card icon={<LoadingIcon />} title="Load More Pagination" href="/docs/pagination/loadMorePagination" />
    </Cards>


It's important to note that the pagination should be consistent, clear, and easy to understand in order to improve the user experience. Also the right pagination method depends on the specific needs of the website and its target audience.
