# Product View

## Overview

In an e-commerce page, the list view and grid view are two different ways of displaying products to users.

List view typically displays products in a vertical, scrolling list format, with each product represented by an individual item. Each item in the list typically includes a product image, name, price, and a brief description. 
The items are usually aligned vertically and take up the entire width of the screen, which allows for a lot of information to be visible at once, and can be helpful for users that want to compare multiple products quickly.
Grid view, on the other hand, displays products in a grid format with multiple products displayed in rows and columns. 
Each product is represented by a thumbnail image and can include the name, price, and a brief description. Grid view allows for a more compact display of products and is useful for situations where there are many products to be displayed on a single page. 
It's usually preferred when the user wants to get an overview of the products quickly.
Both the grid and list view have their own advantages and disadvantages, and it depends on the e-commerce website which view is used as default or an option for the users to switch between them. 
Some websites use grid view as the default, while others use list view. 
Some websites provide an option for the users to switch between views so they can choose which format they prefer.
